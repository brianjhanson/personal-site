# Playing around with Koken
[Koken](http://koken.me/) is a new, free, CMS aimed at creatives. It has a pretty impressive array of features which inticed me enough to install it locally using MAMP. It was a bit of a challenge to get it going for a few reasons. 1) I am not terribly good with the command line. 2) Koken requires ImageMagick which does not come with MAMP and 3) Googling did not provide me an ultra simple guide of how to get this all going. So that's what I'm going to attempt to write here.
