Welcome to my new site. Can I be honest with you for a second? This site is no where near done. This post, for example is hard coded into my blog page because I haven't made the real thing yet. Maybe that's a little too unfinished, but maybe not. I have agonized over it for what seems like years now. What color should the links be? Where should I put the contact icon? Will people know to click the icons? Or should I spell things out? Who knows how many other silly details I've worried about. This weekend I realized, none of those little details matter if I never ship it. Many people have spoken out on the power of shipping but I'll be honest I never really thought much of it. I like to hoard my work in my own little corner because it's never quite right for the world. But I'm tired of that. I don't want to start a bunch of side projects but never push them live. I don't want more things for the "when I have time I'll finish it" pile. This is the first step in an attempt to get more done and be more open. Hopefully it works out for the best.

EDIT: This post has since been moved to the real blog section (go me!).
