My personal playground / website

If future me is looking at this you're probably wondering how the hell to get everything back up and running. Well you're in luck.

v4 of this site is built on [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). To get it up and running all you need to do is
```
gem install jekyll
jekyll serve
```

That should start up a little server where you can view the site. You're welcome.
