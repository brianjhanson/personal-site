<p>When I was a junior in college I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Glimmer-Design-Transform-Maybe-World/dp/1594202338/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1361844367&sr=8-1&keywords=glimmer+how+design+can+transform+your+life+and+maybe+even+the+world" title="Glimmer">Glimmer</a> by Warren Berger which heavily featured the work of <a href="http://www.brucemaudesign.com/" title="Bruce Mau">Bruce Mau</a>. I was immediately inspired by his philosophy and especially by his <a href="http://www.brucemaudesign.com/4817/112450/work/incomplete-manifesto-for-growth" title="Bruce Mau's Incomplete Manifest for Growth">Incomplete Manifesto For Growth</a>. In my studio class I used his manifesto as the text for a loose leaf book featuring illustrations inspired by several of the bullet points in his manifesto.</p>
