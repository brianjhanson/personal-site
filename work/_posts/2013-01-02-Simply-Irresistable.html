<p>Carpet One was looking for a new way to promote Resista brand carpeting. Our team came a simply ir<b>resista</b>ble concept (we love puns). Along with in store promotional prices, we created a Pinterest contest in which people could create Pinterest boards of their favorite home decor items and enter them for a chance to win an exciting prize package from Carpet One. We created many pieces in both print and digital worlds. My responsibilities included many of the digital pieces. I created a landing page for the contest along with a Facebook Tab, Twitter background and other various materials.</p>
