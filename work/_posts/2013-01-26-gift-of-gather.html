<p>Diamond Nuts was looking for a way to promote their nuts in time for the holiday season. With a loose brief our team got to work. We brainstormed for a little while and eventually came up with the idea of a recipe contest that could run on Diamond's Facebook page. Not only would it give their Facebook page more likes but it would be a fun way for people to interact with the brand. Our contest was called the Gift of Gather recipe contest. It was based on the idea that every family has those recipes that they all gather around during the holidays. We wanted people to share those recipes with us as well as try making them with Diamond Nuts. For this project I was responsible for the design of the Facebook presence. The actual Facebook application was built on top of Wildfire and implemented by our developers.</p>
