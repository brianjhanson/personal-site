<p>When the time came to start my final project while in Rome, I was ready to do something a little different from the rest of my class. Something a little more fun, more bold, and more, well, explicative. The project was to create food packaging of any kind. For me, beer was an obvious choice. It would allow me to do something out of the norm and undeniably bold. I created a fictional brand of beer called "Fucking Beer". It was a lot of fun to write the descriptions for the back of the beer as well as use big bold typography to create a beer that would stand out on the shelves. I was also honored to have the designs featured in <a href="http://www.choisgallery.com/Magazine/look/id/560">Choi's Packaging Volume 3</a>.</p>
