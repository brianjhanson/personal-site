<p>Shell came to us in need of a way to promote Pennzoil during the summer. We wanted to create a campaign that was more emotional than Pennzoil is known for. We racked our brains and thought back to the road trips we all took through our lives. We wanted something that would embody the idea of a road trip. In the end we knew that there's one thing that loves road trips more than people ever could. Mn's best friend and stuff.</p>
