<p>While studying abroad my assignment was to brand an area of Rome. The area I chose was the beautiful campo de' fiori.</p>

<p>Once a field of flowers the area is now a bussling square that serves three main purposes. In the morning, it is a fresh food market where many Romans go to buy their daily fruits and veggetables. By the afternoon it has calmed down, many come and grab a cup of coffee others just hang around. In the evening it is the area where many come to party the night away. In order to brand the area I knew my mark would need to represent each of the three times of day. To do this, I created a three dimmensional symbol that could be rotated in order to represent different hours of the day. Along with the symbol I designed letterheads, packaging, posters and a web site.</p>
