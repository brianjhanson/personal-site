I've been a fan of [Jonnie Hallman](https://twitter.com/destroytoday) and his product [Cushion](https://cushionapp.com) for a little while now. So when I saw him launch his [2020.destroytoday.com](http://2020.destroytoday.com/) site, I thought it would be cool to follow suite. Here's the fruits of that. Unlike him, I spent a bit more time hammering out the little things before launching, but I love the idea of building out in the open and documenting it along the way. This site is still pretty bare bones, but I'm hopeful I can get into a routine of updating it with some of my progress.
